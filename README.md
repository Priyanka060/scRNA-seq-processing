# scRNA-seq-processing
 Offers basic preprocessing of raw count matrices

Certain points to note: Part on scRNA-processing
- Working directory initially set is to access files. Saving of all data happens in the directory where the rmd file is stored.
- Changes in the future can be observed in methodology associated with scaling data based on cell cycle genes and number of components chosen for clustering
- Further annotation is in the file titled gsea_annotation. gmt files will also be submitted soon
- Cluster marker csv file and clustered object is to be loaded into GSEA for clustering.
